## Full completions for the Chai Assertion Library

This sublime package will install completions for *bdd* and *tdd*:
- [*should*](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/)
- [*expect*](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/)
- [*assert*](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/)

You can read the [full API for chai syntax](http://chaijs.com/api/).

The completions work in both Javascript and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/).

This package was merged with [pahen's](https://github.com/pahen/) package in Sublime Package Control.

### Installation
